function m_sig = Main_signal(name,channel)
%   Main_signal class constructor.
%   Main_signal(name,channel) constructs main signal with a given name and
%   given channel.
%   Main_signal is the base class of all signals that are not envelopes
%   and which envelopes are being built on top of them.
%   Every main signal has a level component, start time,end time and ramp
%   length components of the ramp. The state of each of the above can be
%   one of the following:
%   1. static - not swept and not using sequenced values. Represented by 0.
%   2. swept values - Represented by 1.
%   3. using sequenced values  - Represented by 2.
